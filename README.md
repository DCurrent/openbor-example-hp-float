How to display hitpoints and other numeric values as a textual percentage on screen.

This is a technical demonstrator of displaying remaining HP as a percentage value. Please note that nearly every other aspect of this module is derived from the original Beats of Rage. It is therefore severely out of date and should not be used as a module authoring example in any other way.

# Instructions

1.	Open the module and play as normal. Note that as you play, the player’s remaining HP percentage will be displayed as text on the left side of the screen. Should a second player join, that player’s HP percentage will be shown immediately below.
2.	If you would like to try adjusting the font, location, and other settings, open the settings.h file. The contents are fairly self-explanatory. Play around a bit to suit your own preferences.

# Notes

- Again, for expedience this demo module is derived from the original Beats of Rage. It’s out of date and only allows two players. The script has no such limits - it can and will automatically adjust to accommodate as many players as you like.
- The script is only designed for players, but with some slight modifications it will work for other entity types too.
